# CodeHS-Remake
A remake of codeHS, with all the function. Also some additional feature. 100% with python


First, you need to have python 1.12+ downloaded.
Then, you need to have things like Replit or Visual Code Studio to edit the code.

Go to mainTerminal.py, this is the only file you should edit.

Set the variable "level" to a number. 0 set it to default, which is a 5x5 world with Karl at Street 1, Avenue 1.

There are 3 premade level, set vaule from 1 - 3.

Try to figure it out, because I havent add goal feature yet.
